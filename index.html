        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Scrambled eggs are a classic breakfast dish made by whisking eggs,
            often with a bit of milk or cream, and then cooking them in a pan
            over medium heat while gently stirring until they're softly set. The
            result is a creamy, fluffy texture with a mild flavor that can be
            seasoned with salt, pepper, and various optional ingredients like
            herbs, cheese, or vegetables for added flavor and texture.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Butter or oil (for cooking)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Crack Eggs: Crack the desired number of eggs into a bowl.
                Typically, you might use 2-3 eggs per serving.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk Eggs: Using a fork or whisk, beat the eggs until the yolks
                and whites are well combined. If you like, you can add a splash
                of milk or cream at this stage for creamier eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season Eggs: Season the beaten eggs with a pinch of salt and a
                grind of black pepper. You can also add other seasonings or
                herbs at this point, such as chopped chives or parsley.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat Pan: Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium
                heat. Allow it to heat up for a minute or two.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add Butter or Oil: Once the pan is hot, add a small amount of
                butter or oil (about 1 teaspoon per egg) to the pan. Allow the
                butter to melt and coat the bottom of the pan evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour Eggs into Pan: Pour the beaten eggs into the pan. Let them
                sit undisturbed for a few seconds to begin cooking around the
                edges.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scramble Eggs: Using a spatula or wooden spoon, gently push the
                eggs from the edges toward the center of the pan. Continue to do
                this every few seconds, allowing the uncooked egg to flow to the
                bottom of the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Control Heat: Adjust the heat as needed to ensure the eggs cook
                evenly and don't brown too quickly. It's important to keep the
                heat gentle to achieve soft, creamy scrambled eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finish Cooking: Continue to gently scramble the eggs until they
                are softly set but still slightly moist. They should have a
                creamy texture with no visible liquid egg remaining.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve Immediately: Transfer the scrambled eggs to a plate and
                serve them hot. They pair well with toast, bacon, sausage, or
                fresh fruit for a complete breakfast. Enjoy!
