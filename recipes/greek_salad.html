        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Greek salad is a refreshing and vibrant dish that celebrates the
            flavors of the Mediterranean. It typically features ripe tomatoes,
            crisp cucumbers, thinly sliced red onions, and briny Kalamata
            olives, all tossed together in a simple dressing of extra virgin
            olive oil and red wine vinegar. The salad is elevated with the
            addition of creamy crumbled feta cheese and aromatic oregano, which
            add richness and depth of flavor. With its colorful presentation and
            harmonious combination of ingredients, Greek salad offers a perfect
            balance of textures and tastes, from the juicy tomatoes to the tangy
            feta cheese. Served chilled or at room temperature, it makes for a
            light and satisfying meal on its own or as a refreshing side dish to
            complement a variety of Mediterranean-inspired meals.
